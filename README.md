## Customizing CoreBots

Use the CoreBots Options. You can find these at _Skua_ > _Menubar_ > _Options_ > _CoreBots_. This will allow you to customize a large portion of CoreBots, this was already possible beforehand, but now it's made a lot more user-friendly.

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I download the scripts?  
**A:** With Skua you don't have to download the scripts yourself. It is handled for you by the client as long as you did the GitHub Authentication.

> **Note:** The current latest Skua version (as long as I update it) can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Skua/releases/latest).

**Q:** I try to run CoreBots/-Dailies/-Farms and get a pop-up, what do I do?  
**A:** All files starting with **"_Core_"** **aren't bots**, they are used by bots.

**Q:** I'm running a bot and I get an error like _"The type or namespace 'CoreBots' could not be found"_, how do I fix it?  
**A:** Open the script you got an error and certify that the first lines with `//cs_include` have the right path/file name, typos happen.

**Q:** Even after doing the solutions above my script doesn't run, what now?  
**A:** Then we might have messed up something. In this case you can reach out to us in Discord: **Breno_Henrike#6959** or **Lord Exelot#9674** and tell which script, the part the problem occurred and the version of Skua you are having trouble with, you can also use the channel _#Skua-Questions-Help_ [in this server](https://discord.io/AQWBots/).
